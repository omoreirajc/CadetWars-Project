# CadetWars-Project

We have been challenged to create a game using Java and SimpleGrafics library ( i don't recommend it tho).
During 9 days and 10 nights we struggled , we strived , and we delivered!

Cadet Wars was meant to be built around our Master Coders and Academia de Codigo's theme set ( Star Wars ).

Feel free to try our game.
Might update in time... or not ! 

NOTE: SimpleGraphics has huge mouse problems and we still used it. It's bugged. Will it work ? Sometimes.
